                Hello! <br><br>

                Welcome to the start of my CART-351 journal.<br>
                If you aren’t in CART-351 and I don’t know you, what are you doing here?<br>
                This is an assignment, so I promise there isn’t much to do here.<br><br>

                However, if you are just here appreciating the website, you clearly must have an eye for
                talent.<br><br>

                So anyways, here’s the deal.<br> I am probably going to update and change a lot on this website.<br>
                I
                want it
                to be pretty unique and have a cool feel by the end of the semester.<br> No promises though, the
                grind
                hasn’t fully set in yet.<br><br>

                Since I entered this class a little late, this entry will probably be a little different.<br>
                So I’ll take this chance to show off a little thing I’ve been working on recently,<br> that being a
                sort
                of
                “Fluid Simulator” I made in Javascript.<br> I used it as a little warm-up in the hopes that I would
                get
                into this
                class, actually.<br><br>

                This little simulator, which you can see to the right of this box (or which alternatively can be
                played
                <a class="text-link" href="https://seanhub-13.github.io/Grid-Fluid/">here</a>),<br> was
                something I was inspired to make when watching a video about cellular automatons and Conway’s “Game
                of
                Life”.<br><br>

                It simulates interactions between solid matter (selected by pressing “1”) and liquid matter
                (selected by
                pressing “2”).<br>
                You can place these by holding down your left mouse button, or delete by pressing the right one.<br>
                There
                are a lot more
                settings, but maybe open the full website for that.<br><br>

                I think this is enough for a starting report, play around with my little project and if you wanna
                say
                hi,<br> don’t be
                afraid to yell my name out loud in class (I might have headphones on but I’m sure you’re dedicated
                if
                you read this?)<br>
