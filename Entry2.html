                Welcome back, dear readers!<br>

                It’s a new week so I have to bring a new entry of <br><br><span class="flash">|_|_____ T H E
                    _____|_|<br>|_| C A

                    R N A L |_|</span><br><br> to the table…<br><br>

                Okay, so today's topic is going to be a sort of re-affirmation (for myself) of what I want to get out of
                this class,<br> and
                out of my stay at Concordia in general.<br>
                I like to think of myself as a game developer, and making games is a pretty big job.<br>
                Really, it's many big jobs, which is exactly what I wanna prepare for.<br><br>

                I have 2 big goals in regards to what I want to accomplish as a game dev.<br>
                One is that I wanna become self-sustaining, as in, I want to be able to make every bit of my own
                projects by myself.<br>
                The other is that I also wanna be capable of providing some measure of work in most fields that pertain
                to making games,<br>
                so that no gap is ever left unfilled in a workflow, and nobody feels directionless when working with
                me.<br><br>

                That's my reason for attending Concordia,<br> and that is something I have started working towards with
                my
                participation in Computation Arts.<br>
                I took Networks and Navigation as a class this semester because I wanted to keep my programming skills
                sharp,<br> and I find
                that's hard for me to do without learning something new.<br>
                In my case, I haven’t used Python in a very long time,<br> and I know very little about the technical
                details of how
                networks work,<br> as well as how I can make use of them to help build up my projects.<br><br>

                Thanks to all that, Networks and Navigation seems like a pretty good choice for a class I could be
                taking,<br> and I hope I
                come out with more understanding and skills than what I came in with.
