                Alright, so this week I figured I should make the journal actually talk a bit more about class and my
                current experience
                in it so far.<br><br>

                My re-introduction to Python has been very smooth so far honestly,<br> and since I have been working
                with
                Javascript a lot
                recently I’ve been sorta porting over my skills over from that.<br>
                Not a big fan of having to make new environments for every project,<br> and I still keep putting “;”
                every
                time I finish a
                line but that's probably gonna keep happening since I work with both languages pretty much every
                day.<br><br>

                Lists and dictionaries make sense when analyzing their function on paper but in practice I am mostly
                learning their
                abilities from my mistakes.<br><br>

                I’ve really been the API request stuff we have been doing,<br> even though it's only sorta new to me
                since I
                have used
                Firebase with Javascript.<br> Still, in this case I get to pull pretty much any type of data I want,<br>
                live
                from the internet
                with pretty low effort, so there's little for me to complain about.<br><br>

                I’ve also been greatly enjoying the new libraries I get to play around with.<br>
                I just started planning / lightly working on the new project we got,<br> and I am of course most likely
                making a game for
                it.<br> Whether I decide to make it an ascii-based game with movement or a text-based choice game,<br>
                both
                <a class="text-link" href="https://pypi.org/project/colorama/">“Colorama”</a> and the
                aptly named <a class="text-link" href="https://pypi.org/project/art/">"art"</a> libraries are going to
                come in handy, and I’ve already created a test environment with
                them.<br><br>

                Overall, while I’m sure the class will give me a lot of challenges in the future, I’m mostly just having
                fun right now.
